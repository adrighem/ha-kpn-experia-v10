*Because your ISP-provided router doesn't have to be a black box.*

This integration wrangles your ZTE H369A (Experia Box v10) into Home Assistant. It speaks both the old language and the shiny new "KPN Software" (V10.C.26.02.06+) dialect, giving you full visibility and control over your home network.

**Note:** This is a modernized and significantly expanded fork of the original [experia-v10-device-tracker](https://github.com/kadima-tech/experia-v10-device-tracker).

## 🚀 What it does

*   **Who's home?** Tracks all connected devices (wired and wireless) using robust network topology traversal. No more guessing.
*   **Speed & Greed:** Monitors real-time download/upload speeds and total data consumption.
*   **Vitals:** Keeps an eye on your External IP, WAN link status, active client count, and router uptime.
*   **Intruder Alert:** Triggers a diagnostic sensor when a wild new device appears on your network.
*   **The Big Buttons:** Reboot the router or toggle Guest Wi-Fi directly from your dashboard.
